## Use it
Just enter one username which has a Public Profile.  
It saves the media in current directory in a Folder named after given username.

## Heads Up
Made by exploring Python. Inspired by similiar programms. Use at own risk.

## Use it to archive important things, be polite and cause no harm.

## Bonus Information
Depending on changes Snap makes, they might or might not block your IP.
